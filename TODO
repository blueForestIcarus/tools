- less-style output scrolling with programable actions (I want to be able to specify e=open vim, c=copy etc.) (an interface builder)
- program to move file to archive and handle multible archives (like how downloads work: myfile.c, myfile.c.1, myfile.c.2)
- tarball style archive that can assert file-nonexistance, and write writetimes, permissions, etc independantly
    -action archive, which is a sequence of above archives, essencially archives sequence of filesystem actions
        - might be useful for cases where the filesystem is not an actual filesystem
